# US-Election-Data-Python-EDA-Project
I am currently a data science fellow at the New York City Data Science Academy.

The 2024 Presidential Election is coming up this year so I thought it would be interesting to visit this topic for my Python EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) project.

Running a political campaign might seem to be very different from running a business, but the two have a lot in common. A political campaign has to deal  with limited resources to deploy within a limited time frame just like any other business. That being said, inevitably, deciding which states to prioritize is crucial for campaign managers. 

I approached this overarching question by looking at it through two different lenses. First of all, I explored how the electoral votes are distributed among states and which states seem to hold more deciding power during the election. Second of all, I took a deep dive into the historical election results to see how the political landscape changed over the past few decades. That included identifying the swing states and the battleground states. Given limited resources, it makes sense for candidates to prioritize states that hold a lot of deciding power and present a chance to win.

For this project, I primarily focused on the Democratic Party and the Republican Party as they are the two major parties that dominate the presidential election.Last, but not least, I was interested in finding out if there is any correlation between voter demographics and the party they voted for during an election. We will get to that part later.
