# US-Election-Data-Python-EDA-Project
I am currently a data science fellow at the New York City Data Science Academy.

This is my first project with the Academy and I try to draw insight from looking into the U.S. Presidential Election results from 1976 to 2020. The dataset I obtained is compiled by MIT Election Data and Science Lab (https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/42MVDX)
