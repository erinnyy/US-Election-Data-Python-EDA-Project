# US-Election-Data-Python-EDA-Project
I am currently a data science fellow at the New York City Data Science Academy.

This is my first project with the Academy. In this analysis the data was explored, several features were engineered, and finally visualizations were created to reveal the pattern and trend to help answer the main research question "which states we should prioritize in the coming up 2024 Presidential Election". Please find the link to my Google Slides deck below.
