# US-Election-Data-Python-EDA-Project
I am currently a data science fellow at the New York City Data Science Academy.

The 2024 Presidential Election is coming up this year so I thought it would be interesting to visit this topic for my Python EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) project.

Running a political campaign might seem to be very different from running a business but it is not. At the end of the day, It is faced with limited resources to deploy within a limited time frame just like any other business. That being said, deciding which states to prioritize becomes inevitable and crucial for campaign managers. I approached this overarching question by looking at it through two different lenses. First of all, I explored how the electoral votes are distributed among states and which states seem to hold more deciding power during the election. Second of all, I took a deep dive into the historical election results to see how the political landscape changed over the past few decades and which states seem to be the swing states and which are the battleground states. It makes more sense to prioritize states that hold a lot of deciding power and present a chance to win.

For the scope of this project, I primarily focused on the Democratic Party and the Republican Party as they are the two major parties that dominate the presidential election.

Last but not least, I was interested in finding out if there is any pattern between voter demographics and the party they voted for during an election. Analysis was done in the third part of the project. Please find the link to my Google Slides deck below.
